end, the only person I truly want to comfort me is Haymitch,
because he loves Peeta, too. I reach out for him and say
something like his name and he's there, holding me and
patting my back. "It's okay. It'll be okay, sweetheart." He sits
me on a length of broken marble pillar and keeps an arm
around me while I sob.
"I can't do this anymore," I say.
"I know," he says.
"All I can think of is--what he's going to do to Peeta--
because I'm the Mockingjay!" I get out.
"I know." Haymitch's arm tightens around me.
"Did you see? How weird he acted? What are they--
doing to him?" I'm gasping for air between sobs, but I
manage one last phrase. "It's my fault!" And then I cross
some line into hysteria and there's a needle in my arm and
the world slips away.
It must be strong, whatever they shot into me, because
it's a full day before I come to. My sleep wasn't peaceful,
though. I have the sense of emerging from a world of dark,
haunted places where I traveled alone. Haymitch sits in the
chair by my bed, his skin waxen, his eyes bloodshot. I
remember about Peeta and start to tremble again.
Haymitch reaches out and squeezes my shoulder. "It's
all right. We're going to try to get Peeta out."
"What?" That makes no sense.
"Plutarch's sending in a rescue team. He has people
on the inside. He thinks we can get Peeta back alive," he
says.
"Why didn't we before?" I say.
"Because it's costly. But everyone agrees this is the
thing to do. It's the same choice we made in the arena. To
do whatever it takes to keep you going. We can't lose the
Mockingjay now. And you can't perform unless you know
Snow can't take it out on Peeta." Haymitch offers me a cup.
"Here, drink something."
I slowly sit up and take a sip of water. "What do you
mean, costly?"
He shrugs. "Covers will be blown. People may die. But
keep in mind that they're dying every day. And it's not just
Peeta; we're getting Annie out for Finnick, too."
"Where is he?" I ask.
