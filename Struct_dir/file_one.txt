Black tea is a bold, flavorful and energizing way lots of people begin their day across the world. Since its' 
discovery in the 17th century in China and subsequent popularity, people in different cultures, cities, and villages 
in almost every country consume tea on a regular basis. Black tea is the backbone of many global drinks, such as Tibetan Po cha,
 bubble tea or milk tea. In certain regions of the world, black tea is the foundation for cultural events, such as tea ceremonies! 
The process of preparing black tea in Russian tea ceremonies are far different from a Chinese tea ceremony. The difference lies 
in the preparation and history of the ceremony itself, with Russian ceremonies strictly using strongly brewed loose and large 
leaf black tea, while Chinese ceremonies involve the usage of literature and art into the ceremony process. 
Preparing and serving black tea has always been the 
perfect complement to ceremonies or just a simple night at home.
