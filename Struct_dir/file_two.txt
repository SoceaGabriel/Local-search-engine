Today, tea is grown all over the world, and different countries have different standards for what qualifies
 as organic. However, organic tea cultivation focuses on the use of naturally occurring minerals and nutrients
 to promote growth, along with the use of natural methods to eliminate any harmful insects and weeds that may 
affect healthy crop growth. Choosing an organically grown tea means it has not been exposed to any toxic soil
 conditions or heavy metals. Many pesticides have been outlawed in America and Europe but may be used in other 
parts of the world. If tea is grown in a country that has yet to ban the use of harmful chemicals, choosing an 
organic tea is advisable to protect yourself against the risk of ingesting any harmful pesticide residues.
